## Fuzzy Min-Max Classifier:

An implmenetation of Fuzzy min-max classifer first introduced by Patrick Simpson in [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/redirect.jsp?arnumber=/72/4097/00159066.pdf) in 1992.

This repository contains the code for my blog post explaning the working and learning algorithm for this classifier.
