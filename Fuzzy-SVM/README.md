# Fuzzy-SVM

Based on research paper “FSVM-CIL: Fuzzy Support Vector Machines for Class Imbalance Learning” by Rukshan Batuwita and Vasile Palade which discuss Fuzzy concept

It is used for optimazation of algorithm for imbalanced datasets which do not have 1:1 no.  of instances of each class.

# Datasets used

Pima Indians diabities dataset has 35:65 ratio in their class.
